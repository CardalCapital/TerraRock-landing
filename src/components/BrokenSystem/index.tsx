              <h3>A Broke System</h3>
              <p>
                Itâ€™s estimated that over $200 billion is spent on the
                acquisition and resale of personal identifiable information
                (PII) in the United States each year. This is data used to
                identify real-world people so that brands, agencies, and
                technology companies can sell, market, or target a specific
                demographic, interest group, or characteristic of that person.
                For context, that is roughly equivalent to the gross domestic
                product (GDP) of New Zealand.
