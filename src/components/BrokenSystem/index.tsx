            Itâ€™s estimated that over $200 billion is spent on the acquisition
            and resale of personal identifiable information (PII) in the United
            States each year. This is data used to identify real-world people so
            that brands, agencies, and technology companies can sell, market, or
            target a specific demographic, interest group, or characteristic of
            that person. For context, that is roughly equivalent to the gross
            domestic product (GDP) of New Zealand.

            Where is this data coming from and how is it used? Why are you, the
