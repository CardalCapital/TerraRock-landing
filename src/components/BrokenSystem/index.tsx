              Itâ€™s estimated that over $200 billion is spent on the acquisition
              and resale of personal identifiable information (PII) in the
              United States each year. This is data used to identify real-world
              people so that brands, agencies, and technology companies can
              sell, market, or target a specific demographic, interest group, or
              characteristic of that person. For context, that is roughly
              equivalent to the gross domestic product (GDP) of New Zealand.

              Where is this data coming from and how is it used? Why are you,
              the individual, not in control of how, why, and where your data is
              used? Why are you not compensated for when your data is used?
